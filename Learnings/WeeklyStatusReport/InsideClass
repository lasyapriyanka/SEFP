What you learnt inside the class?

Week 1:
Date: 5 Aug 2016

#1 I’m a part of software engineering course now.
#2 In our first class we learned about what is quality software. What does it actually mean?
#3 Started to think from the manufacturer’s perspective.
#4 Discussed about the augmented reality game “POKEMON GO”.
#5 How to determine the whether the features of your product are dissatisfiers, satisfiers and delighters.

Week 2:
Date: 12 Aug 2016

#1 This week we discussed more about the ideas and projects which we have.
#2 Teams were formed.
#3 All of our classmates had crazy ideas. Like give blood take blood, flirt alert :D etc. but we all forgot to think in broader perspective.

Week 3: 
Date: 19 Aug 2016

#1 In this week’s morning class I have mainly spent my time in learning what actually Software Engineering is for. Basically Software engineering is the application of engineering to the design, development,implementation,testing and maintenance of software in a systematic way. 
#2 We also learnt what are the core requirements to be a good software engineer. 
   Typically they are 5. Programing, Design,Process,Communication and Teamwork.
#3 One thing that questioned me was that, Why I’m studying this course, what is software engineering actually meant for?
#4 I feel that this course can help me to acquire new skills, improve my ability to solve complex programs and most importantly to develop high quality software.
#5 We also learned about two important principles.
   -->Abstraction
   -->Decomposition
#6 Is there any difference between science and software engineering? Still need to figure that out.
#7 In Afternoon class, sridhar sir assigned us a task to write the similarities and differences between MOVIE MAKING and SOFTWARE ENGINEERING.
#8 Most of us thought that there are more similarities between movie making and software engineering. Even I felt so.

Week 4:
Date: 26 Aug 2016

#1 Learned about the requirements engineering and life cycle of software.
#2 Important factors in development of software.
   -->People
   -->Processes
   -->Tools
   -->Products
#3 Discussed about stakeholders.
#4 We also listed out the requirements of facebook and later represented them in mathematical/pictorial/graphical form.
#5 Learned about Eliciting and planning
#6 Other different models in software development which are derived from the waterfall model.
#7 Learned how prototyping model plays an important in knowing what actually customer wants


Week 5:
Date: 2 Sep 2016

#1 We had big debate on Agile models
#2 Learned about many software development models like waterfall, Prototyep,Spiral, Agile etc
#3 To calculate the time required to build a project, there are different methods.
   Some of them are Top down, Bottom up, LOC, function points etc;
#4 To get a good adaptive model it should be combination of agile methods and unified processes.
#5 Basic overview of COCOMO model for estimation

Week 6:
Date: 16 Sep 2016
#1 Today we discussed about the design part of the project.
#2 Design is basically a representation of our solution to a given problem statement
#2 A good project design should follow this order
   Goals --> Constraints --> Assumptions --> Decisions --> Ideas
#3 We had discussed on one of our classmates projects "To check the security of an application" we followed the above order and wrote the design process.
#4 Code is a design at lowest level of abstarction.
#5 Learned about desirability and Feasibility
#6 Desirability -->What we need to accomplish ?
                --> How does a user interact with the projct?

#7 Feasibility --> What is the core concept of the project and  its implementation details?
